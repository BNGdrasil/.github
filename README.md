# BNGdrasil (BNbong + Yggdrasil)

A personal cloud nation infrastructure project by *bnbong*

BNGdrasil is a comprehensive cloud ecosystem that integrates personal portfolio, game platform, API services, and authentication systems. All infrastructure is managed through **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles, designed to operate seamlessly across global cloud environments (Oracle Cloud, AWS, Azure) and future home lab (OpenStack-based) environments.

## Project Naming Convention

Each sub-project in BNGdrasil combines **bnbong's name + Norse mythology/concepts**:

- **BNGdrasil (Main Project)**: The overarching project name (bnbong + Yggdrasil, the World Tree)

### Sub-projects

1. **üèóÔ∏è [Baedalus (IaC)](https://github.com/BNGdrasil/Baedalus)**
   - Terraform-based infrastructure code project
   - Declarative management of CSP environments (Oracle Cloud, etc.) and home lab (OpenStack) infrastructure
   - (bnbong + Daedalus)

2. **üåê [Bsgard (Custom VPC)](https://github.com/BNGdrasil/Bsgard)**
   - Custom network project wrapping OpenStack Neutron functionality
   - Provides VPC-like features for CSP environments
   - Manages VM resource placement in home lab environment with Public/Private Subnet architecture
   - (bnbong + Asgard)

3. **üåâ [Bifrost (API Gateway)](https://github.com/BNGdrasil/Bifrost)**
   - FastAPI-based API Gateway service
   - API service routing, logging, authentication/authorization (JWT, API Key)
   - Admin UI integration for service registration and management
   - (bnbong + Bifrost)

4. **üîê [Bidar (Auth Server)](https://github.com/BNGdrasil/Bidar)**
   - FastAPI-based authentication server
   - JWT-based authentication/authorization, Superuser management
   - PostgreSQL/Redis integration for user and session management
   - (bnbong + Vidar)

5. **üé® [Bantheon (Web Client + Portfolio)](https://github.com/BNGdrasil/Bantheon)**
   - React-based static frontend
   - Portfolio pages and Admin Client functionality
   - Integration with API Gateway and Auth Server for administrative operations
   - (bnbong + Pantheon)

6. **üéÆ [Blysium (Game Platform)](https://github.com/BNGdrasil/Blysium)**
   - React-based static frontend
   - Platform for browser-executable games collection
   - Minimal user management, focused on game execution and selection
   - (bnbong + Elysium)

```

## Technology Stack

- **Backend (API Gateway, Auth Server)**: Python 3.12+ (FastAPI)
- **Frontend (Portfolio, Game Platform, Admin UI)**: React (Vite-based)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose (‚Üí Kubernetes scalable)
- **Database & Cache**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
- **DNS & Proxy**: Cloudflare + Nginx Proxy Manager
- **Cloud / Virtualization**: Oracle Cloud ‚Üí OpenStack (Home Lab)

## Security & Access Control

- **Public Services Protection**: Cloudflare DNS & Proxy + WAF
- **Private Subnet Isolation**: External access restricted (VPN/Bastion Host only)
- **Service Deployment**: Docker Compose-based VM deployment (Kubernetes expansion planned)

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ
